# Laptops Price Prediction Using Web Scraping and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is divided into five parts to demonstrate the process of collecting data from online stores, preprocessing it, building a machine learning model to predict prices, creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, and deploying an API service.

## Part 1: Data Collection and Model Building
- Collect data from online stores to train a machine learning model for price prediction.

## Part 2: Data Preprocessing and Analysis
- Perform data preprocessing to clean missing and invalid data.
- Conduct analysis and visualization to gain insights into the dataset.

## Part 3: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Develop a GUI to interact with users and gather required information for price prediction.
- Users are prompted to input CPU type, RAM size, GPU type, SSD and HDD size, screen size, and operating system.

## Part 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation
- Build a machine learning model to predict prices based on the collected features.
- Display predicted prices for the specified features.

## Part 5: API Service Deployment
- Deploy an API service to provide price prediction functionality to users.

### Hint:
- Users must input all required features, but can select at least one type of hard drive.
- They can also choose to view all laptops within a certain price range.

## Additional Features:
- NLP Model Usage: Incorporate NLP models for text analysis and processing of product descriptions.
- Regular Expression for NLP: Utilize regular expressions for advanced text pattern matching and extraction.
